Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2014
* M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Mayrland, College Park, 2019
* Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, 2019

Work experience
======
* 02/2020 - Present: Principal Data Scientist
  * Origin Wireless AI, Greenbelt, MD
  * WiFi-sensing for home security
    * Designed and optimized motion localization algorithm for WiFi-sensing devices.
    * Wrote Python tools for customers to process and visualize motion data.
    * Designed and automated a manufacture workflow by Python to build WiFi-sensing devices.
    * Reduced time consumption of building up one set of devices from about 40 min to 5 min.
    * Built 155 sets of devices for Verizon Communications Inc. to support their development and testing.
  * Real-time location tracking
    * Built an App using Python (Kivy and Buildozer) to track human location in real time based only on inertial measurement unit sensors from phone.
    * Optimized the tracking algorithm and achieved centimeter-level accuracy.
* 05/2019 - 08/2019: DSP Research Intern
  * Starkey Hearing Technologies, Eden Prairie, MN
  * DNN-based Speech Enhancement
    * Designed and conducted subjective listening experiment to test DNN-based speech enhancement algorithms.
    * Analyzed experimental data and compared DNN algorithms.
  * Joint Approach of Auditory Attention Decoding and Speech Enhancement
    * Designed and conducted electroencephalography (EEG) experiment to simulate a cocktail party scenario.
    * Collected auditory responses while subjects switch attention from one speaker to another.
    * Developed algorithm for joint approach of attention decoding and speech enhancement.
* 08/2015 - 05/2019: Graduate Research Assistant
  * University of Maryland, College Park, MD
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonathan Z. Simon
  * Mutual Information Analysis of Auditory Brain Responses and Effects of Aging
    * Developed a novel approach based on information theory to decode phase-locked response from M/EEG recording.
    * Revealed speech over-representation in the aging midbrain [J1] and cortical [J2] marker of behaviors.
    * Algorithm programmed in Matlab, source-space analysis done in Python and statistics conducted in R.
  * Machine Learning Applications in Auditory Research
    * Implemented KNN and CNN for schizophrenia detection based on auditory steady-state response features.
    * Designed and compared neural decoders based on maximum likelihood estimation, linear regression and neural network to study adaptive efficient coding of correlated acoustic properties in auditory cortex of ferret.
    * Developed object and edge detection approach to extract pupillometry information from video recordings to study implicit memory for complex sounds in auditory cortex of ferret.
