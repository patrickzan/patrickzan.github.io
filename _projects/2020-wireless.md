* Indoor tracking and navigation based on IMU sensors on mobile devices

When you are playing <a href="https://www.pubgmobile.com/en-US/" style="text-decoration: none">PUBG Mobile</a>, one way your mobile device, iPhone, iPad or Android, tracks your motion is by gyroscope, which measures the orientation and angular velocity of the device, and posits the gaming avatar to the corresponding direction. Other applications, such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204523" style="text-decoration: none">Workout</a>, take advantages of more built-in motion sensors, accelerometer and gravity sensor, etc, to track your activities. All these sensors are called inertial measurement units (IMU), and can be useful in many applications. In this project, we built a tracking App, using these sensors to track a user's motion in the 3D space and infer his or her location in real-time. Tracking without GPS becomes handy in a place where GPS signal is weak, inaccurate or unavailable, such as in a shopping mall, a large building or mountain area. Our App is always standing by whenever this happens.

Check out the App demo here (Android and iOS).
