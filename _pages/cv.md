    * Designed and conducted electroencephalography (EEG) experiment to simulate a cocktail party scenario.
    * Collected auditory responses while subjects switch attention from one speaker to another.
    * Developed algorithm for joint approach of attention decoding and speech enhancement.
* 08/2015 - 05/2019: Graduate Research Assistant
  * University of Maryland, College Park, MD
  * Supervisor: Prof. Jonathan Z. Simon
  * Mutual Information Analysis of Auditory Brain Responses and Effects of Aging
    * Developed a novel approach based on information theory to decode phase-locked response from M/EEG recording.
    * Revealed speech over-representation in the aging midbrain [J1] and cortical [J2] marker of behaviors.
    * Algorithm programmed in Matlab, source-space analysis done in Python and statistics conducted in R.
  * Machine Learning Applications in Auditory Research
    * Implemented KNN and CNN for schizophrenia detection based on auditory steady-state response features.
    * Designed and compared neural decoders based on maximum likelihood estimation, linear regression and neural network to study adaptive efficient coding of correlated acoustic properties in auditory cortex of ferret.
    * Developed object and edge detection approach to extract pupillometry information from video recordings to study implicit memory for complex sounds in auditory cortex of ferret.
